I'm happy to announce that I'll be presenting at [SQLSaturday #275](http://sqlsaturday.com/275/) in Copenhagen on March 29th!

<!-- more -->

I'll be presenting my **Recovering Data from Fatally Corrupt Databases** session:

> Imagine the worst case scenario: Your database won't come online. Lots of checksum errors logged. DBCC CheckDB won't even run on the database. And worst of all - you have no backups! Now what do you do with this 20GB binary blob of an MDF file? In this demo-rich session I will briefly introduce the internals of MDF files while primarly concentrating on how to manually extract data from corrupt databases. I will be using the OrcaMDF RawDatabase framework to do most of the parsing, which will also be explained during the session.

If you want to be able to [save the day](/sql-server-corruption-recovery-when-all-else-fails/) when all other options are exhausted, you shouldn't miss this session.
