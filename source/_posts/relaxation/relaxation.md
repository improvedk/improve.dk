Today was a weird day. Yesterday was the day that the WSOP Day 2B was played. Since we (me and Rune - the only two left in the WSOP ME from the camp) both played on 2A, we had the day off. Today is the official WSOP ME break day before we start on the 5 day marathon beginning from tomorrow, friday, day 3.

Neither of us wanted to do anything big today as it's very important that we get our sleep and are ready for the big and long day tomorrow. I got up somewhere between 2 PM and 5 PM, don't really remember when exactly. We ordered dinner through Dominos (absolutely excellent online ordering service!), so we didn't have to leave the house at all.

I joined Rune into the Rio at about 11 PM since he needed to register for his ITIN number in the event that he cashes in the WSOP - which all odds are beginning to speak in favor of. Without an ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number) the USA will hold back 30% of your winnings to pay the american taxes. Being an alien you don't have to pay these taxes, but if you have not registered for an ITIN number, you're shit outta luck.

After being beat endlessly in pool (seriously, I suck at it) I decided to head for bed early tonight (1 AM). Tomorrow at noon, history will unfold!
