Ahh, Vegas, I just can't get enough of that place!

<!-- more -->

I'm leaving for Vegas again on the 6th of January, planning to be back on the 16th of Janaury. Just a short trip to cope with my dependance on the greatest town in the world!

I will be participating in the [2007 Internal CES](http://www.cesweb.org/default.asp) as well as hopefully being able to get a spot at the Venetian Palazzo Ballrom on the 7th when [Bill Gates himself holds a Pre-show Keynote Address](http://www.cesweb.org/attendees/conferences/keynotes.asp).

Also I'd be rather surprised of myself if I didn't pay some of the greatest poker rooms of Vegas a revisit :)
