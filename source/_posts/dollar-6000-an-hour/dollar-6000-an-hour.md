First off, let me give you the good news. I just bought a new car. A '2000 Audi TT 1,8T to be precise. The bad news however is that I'm 21 years old, only got about one and a half years seniority and at last, I'm male. Those three properties make up for a worst case scenario for any insurance application form. Anyways, here's a chronological list of the insurance companies I called and their reponses:

<!-- more -->

### Tryg

Tryg was able to offer me an impressive price of 94.000 kroners ($16.337) per year. Thats roughly 1/3 the price of the car. Thanks... I guess.

### GF

Forget it. GF is my current company, they didn't want nothing to do with my new car.

### Topdanmark

Topdanmark just saved me 60k, they were able to offer me the same insurance for 34.000 kroners ($5.909) per year.

### Alka

Alka didn't want to insure me, even though I offered to take their "Respekt for fart" (respect for speed) training course.

### AROS

"NO way, we don't insure cars like that".

### Alm. Brand

The best so far, giving me an offer of 27.000 per year ($4.692).

### Fair

The Fair CS started laughing after I'd mentioned my age and car, then he hung up.

### Trekroner

Trekroner is the winner. They offered me an insurance of 25.000 per year ($4.345).

### Danske Forsikringer

"I wouldn't bet on that", that's what they told me before giving me the price of 69.000 per year ($11.992).

### Codan

After explicitly requiring me to move all my other insurances over to them, Codan offered me an insurance on the car for 36.000 per year ($6.256).

### IF

IF thought I was joking when I called them and told my age and car. While trying to reason with them that I weren't joking, they hung up.

## Conclusion

All in all, calling around to the various insurance companies took me a total of about two hours. The result of those two hours is that I went from $16.337 per year all the way down to $4.345 per year. That's a saving of $11.992, giving me an hourly wage of about $6.000, that's not too shabby!
