Unfortunately it's been quite silent around here for the last couple of months. I want to change that, so why not make a promise?

I've always been bullied by my wannabe developer friends for memorizing most of the Win32 (XP onwards) API. What they don't realize is just how useful the API is - how powerful it is!

For the complete month of April 2007, I will post a new blog each day containing a Win32 API trick including demonstration code. Although my samples will be in C#, this being the Win32 API, it's actually usable in more or less any language you want.

I look forward to my missionary work in the name of the holy Win32 API!
