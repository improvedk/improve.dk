title: And Thus I Lost My Introduction

Seeing as most of my presentations are rather technical, I like to start by pointing out the fact that I have no finished higher education (though in progress), no major certifications or recognitions/awards. This leaves a perfect opportunity for me to explain, from the ground up, why I still feel qualified to be standing in front of the audience.

Today I can no longer use that introduction, as I’ve been awarded as a Microsoft MVP (SQL Server) for 2013. I’m honored to receive the award, but mostly, I’m thankful to my friends in the SQL Family.

The last couple of years have been busy, 2012 definitely taking the cake, by my standards. Through my SQL Server engagement I’ve made countless of friends across the world - The Netherlands, Slovenia, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Sweden, all over the US, South Africa, UK, and many more. I remember how my parents worried about how you couldn’t make friends through the computer… While generally being right, on this point, they were not.

As 2012 neared its end, I also promised myself that I would slow down a tad in 2013. I will still try to keep that promise. I simply cannot afford to travel around as much as I did last year, and I really want to trade just a bit of conference travel for pure leisure travel time. However, this doesn’t mean I’ll go into hibernation for the duration of 2012. Currently I’m scheduled to be presenting at the [Warm Crocodile](http://warmcrocconf.net/) conference in Copenhagen on January 17th and I know I’ll do my utmost to attend the PASS Summit this year, having missed it in 2012. What else 2013 will bring, time will tell :)
