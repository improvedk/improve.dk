Time flies fast. Back in 2006, during my time as an [MSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Student_Partners), I made a series of presentations on securing intellectual property in .NET code, resulting in my [Securing .NET Code](/securing-dotnet-code-article/) article. Although it's about two years old, most points are still valid today, unfortunately.

I recorded a screencast of this article sometime in 2007, but I never really got it published, except for a link on the Microsoft Denmark site. It was my first screencast and unfortunately I made some mistakes, the biggest one being the click sounds from the mouse. An even bigger mistake was me deleting the original Camtasia recording files so I can't create a new version without them.

Never the less, if you prefer watching to reading, it might be interesting to look through.
