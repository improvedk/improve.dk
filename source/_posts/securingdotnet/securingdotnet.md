During the last couple of weeks, I have been giving lectures on the subject of .NET code protection at some of the danish universities.

Part of being a Microsoft Student Partner is exactly this, travelling the universities and spreading knowledge of the Microsoft platform. Naturally .NET is the most exciting topic to talk about as the primary audience mostly consists of computer scientists.

Due to my work as a MSP I've got my 2006 Tech-Ed conference entry ticket paid, so I'm taking a short trip to Barcelona on the 8th of november untill the 11th of november. Hopefully I'll get a lot of hands-on experiences with the new technologies and platforms, I can't wait!
