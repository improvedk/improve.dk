In just a couple of weeks [SQLSaturday #196](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/196/eventhome.aspx) will be happening on April 20th in Copenhagen, Denmark. This is a **free** day smack-filled with great speakers, many of them international! [Just check out the schedule.](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/196/schedule.aspx)

I cannot recommend attending SQLSaturdays enough, especially so if they're close to you. Whether you're a SQL Server or .NET developer, DBA or a BI person, there's relevant content for you. Looking beyond the schedule, SQLSaturdays are excellent networking opportunities where people from very different business areas meet and mingle.

If you want to go all in, there's even three precons on Friday the 19th of April - one of which I'm presenting, the other two by [Denny Cherry](http://mrdenny.com/) and [Jen Stirrup](http://www.jenstirrup.com/). You can [see the lineup and register here](http://sqlsat196precon.eventbrite.com/).
