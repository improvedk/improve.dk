Last week I attended the [Miracle Open World 2011 conference](http://mow2011.dk/). As in the previous years the 80% content, 80% social moniker held true to its reputation. My legs and arms are still sore from carrying four-man rubber rings to the top of the four-story waterslide â€“ not the typical aftermath of a conference. I met a lot of new awesome people and managed to pull of a couple of presentations with decent success as well, judging from the responses I've had so far. I've included the slides & demo code for the presentations below.

## Anatomy of an MDF File

*Ever felt like SQL Server slowed you down, and you'd rather just get the data yourself using a HEX editor? In this deep dive session I'll give a run through of the MDF file format, what kind of page types exists? How are records stored on pages? How can we use this knowledge for optimizing performance and (catastrophic) disaster recovery? This session is not for the faint of heart. There will be bytes!*

## How GUIDs Will Ruin Your Life

*GUIDs make our lives simpler in lots of ways - reducing rountrips, decentralized ID generation, pseudo-security, etc. However, they come with a hefty price that may be overlooked untill it's too late.*

*In this session I will give a thorough review of the hidden costs of using GUIDs in your systems. As they may be required, I will look at ways to alleviate the cost of GUIDs while still maintaining the semantic functionality*
