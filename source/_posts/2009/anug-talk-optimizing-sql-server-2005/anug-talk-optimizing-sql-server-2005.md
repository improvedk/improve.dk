Tonight I held my SQL Server Optimization talk at [ANUG](http://www.anug.dk/). There was an impressive turnout of almost 50 people, and based on the feedback I've received so far, I think it went alright :)

You can download the slides, code and sample database (with sample data) below. Note that slides are in Danish.

I'm afraid the query scripts are not in text format, they're only included as images in the slides. I'll probably be presenting some of the topics on my blog over time, where the scripts will also be included.
