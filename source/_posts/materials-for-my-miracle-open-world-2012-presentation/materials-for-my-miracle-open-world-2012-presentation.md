Last Thursday I did a full-day presentation at Miracle Open World 2012 on the SQL Server storage engine and MDF file internals.

As mentioned in the session, I usually don't post my precon slidedeck and materials publicly. If you attended the session, please send me an email at [mark@improve.dk](mailto:mark@improve.dk) and I'll send you the slides + demos for my session :)
