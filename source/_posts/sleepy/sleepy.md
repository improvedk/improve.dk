I got back home from Spearmint at around 7:30 AM, pretty wasted to say the least. I know from experience that setting my alarm clock on my cell phone won't help as I'll just keep sleeping if I don't have a life threatening reason to get out of bed, so I'd just sleep until I woke up.

I woke up just three hours later at around 11 AM... Hmm, I really did plan to get just a little bit more slep, or else I'd be completely burned out that night. I closed my eyes for a second... When I woke up again it was dark outside, it was 8:30 PM, yikes, that was a bit longer than I'd anticipated.

I had planned on playing the $1500 NLHE WSOP event on the next day, so this really fucked up my plans as my sleeping pattern was now pretty awkward. The WSOP event started at 11 AM that very next morning, and the event will run for up to 12 hours, so there would be no doubt that I'd be near death if I were to last that long.

I ended up getting a 20 minute power nap that night before I took a cab to the Rio at 9 AM to get some breakfast, register for the WSOP event and get myself prepared.

I was actually quite awake even though I'd been up for some hours by that time, so I felt prepared. The tournament was a short experience unfortunately, and I can't blame anyone but myself. I made a terrible call in a pot that should've been an easy laydown.

I had around 1800, I'd just been moved to a new table, having Hassan Habib right across the table, and Vanessa Rousso (very cute) to my right. I get **A**h**J**c in MP with a single caller before me (blinds 25/25). I make it 150, I get two callers. The flop comes **J**s**3**d**2**d which is nearly perfect for me. Checked to me, I bet out around 350 out, both callers call again. The turn comes with a scary **6**d. Now suddenly the EP caller bets out the pot, effectively putting me all in. I pondered over this bet a long time, why would he bet out this hard if he'd made his flush? Wouldn't he either be going for the checkraise or simply betting less strongly to induce a raise? I ended up reasoning with myself that he must've had some kind of semi weak holding like KJ, TJ, 9J or something similar, and he wanted to take down the pot now using the scare card / bet. I pushed all in. Both callers instacalled - yuck. The LP caller showed 22 for the flopped set, and the EP caller show **7**d**9**d. I was drawing dead. The river brought the **3**s to fill up the LP caller, raking in a massive pot.

Having just 125 chips left I managed to triple up. Unfortunately I busted out with AQs against Vanessa's AKo, fair'n'square. I didn't last more than one and a half our. I really can't believe I didn't manage to fold that hand now that I've thought it through.

It's now 7:30 PM and I'm going to bed. I wanna be really rested when I'm playing the next $1500 NLHE event tomorrow (there are two $1500 NLHE events left that I'm going to play).
