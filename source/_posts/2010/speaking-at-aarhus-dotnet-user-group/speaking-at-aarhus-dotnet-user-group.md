On April 28th I'll be giving a presentation at [Aarhus .NET User Group](http://www.anug.dk/) on SharedCache. The presentation will be part of a combined event where Morten Jokumsen will be presenting Velocity and Jakob Tikj√∏b Andersen will be presenting Cassandra.

I'll give a quick run through of what SharedCache is and what it's not, how to use it and what you can expect from it. If all goes well, I'll have my EC2 SharedCache cluster up and running for demo purposes :)
