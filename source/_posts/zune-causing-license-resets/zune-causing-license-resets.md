I've had my Vista PC running for quite some months now without problems, as well as Adobe Acrobat Professional and Adobe Photoshop. But not anymore...

Yesterday I plugged in the Zune that I bought on a trip to the US in january. I got the installer / driver software from zune.net. During the installation the installer requested me to update my Zune firmware, which I did. Everything went smooth.

I then left my PC for some hours to go to work. When I got back I was shown a dialog saying that my hardware configuration had changed and that I needed to reactivate Vista, hmmm. I tried the automatic activation but it said my key was already in use. After calling the automatic activation service phone number I got Vista reactivated, weird stuff.

Then suddenly Adobe Acrobat said that my current license was invalid and that I had to reactivate the software. I had to do this twice as I got the exact same message the next time I started Acrobat:

And now today I just started Photoshop, and Guess what came up:

Did me plugging in my Zune cause all of this? I have not made any other hardware changes for months, but how in the world would plugging in an MP3 player cause such a mess?
