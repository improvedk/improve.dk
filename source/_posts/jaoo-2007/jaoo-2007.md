I will be attending JAOO this year, I'm looking forward to a packed calendar in excitement:

It's a tough decision, choosing which sessions to fit into the available slots. There are several slots where I'd love to watch multiple sessions.

I look forward to meeting a lot of people, colleagues and friends. Conferences are superb for developing ones network.

I like the multitude of technologies and areas that are covered at JAOO, Java, JavaScript, .NET, virtualization, architecture and so forth. I'd love to see some more DBA related sessions though (especially MSSQL 2008).
