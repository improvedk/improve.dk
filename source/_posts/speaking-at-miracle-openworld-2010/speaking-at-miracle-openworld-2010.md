## Working with PDF documents

In this session he will sharing his experiences with dissecting PDF documents for the iPaper system. We'll look at various commercial as well as open source tools for reading, editing and rasterizing PDF documents. What are some of the common pitfalls you'll run into when working with PDF documents and what does a PDF really consist of internally? While some of the tools and libraries can also be used to create PDFs, this session will concentrate on working with existing PDF files.

## SQL Azure for DBA's

Will be presenting together with Martin Schmidt from Miracle. Abstract is still in the works. It's safe to say though that this will be no typical sales pitch - we'll be looking at what limitations you'll run into, what happens when you reach the limits of SQL Azure and generally what the sales pitch happily ignores.

I highly recommend going to MOW as this is one of the best DBA & developer conferences with networking and fun being in the high seat! There's a beach party - what more do you need?
