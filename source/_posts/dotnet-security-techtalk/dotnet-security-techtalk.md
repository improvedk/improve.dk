I will be hosting two TechTalks on security in .NET, at Microsoft Denmark in August. The TechTalks will be held in DANISH.

[Jakob Andersen](http://www.intellect.dk/) will be co-hosting the TechTalks, hopefully filling in on my weak points and vice versa.

I urge participants to comment on this post regarding topics you would like us to talk about, problems you've had, suggestions and so forth.

If you're not attending, please comment anyways - I'll be blogging a lot on security for the time being and I'm always seeking relevant topics to research further :)
