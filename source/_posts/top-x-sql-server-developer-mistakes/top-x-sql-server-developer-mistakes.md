It's been a long day, and I'm finally on my way home from Copenhagen to Aarhus. Unfortunately I wasn't able to attend the first day of the Warm Crocodile conference yesterday. Thankfully I was able to attend today, and even better, I got a chance to present my "Top X SQL Server Developer Mistakes" session today, and I'd like to thank everybody who showed up and helped fill the room to its limit. I got a lot of excellent questions during, as well as after, the session. If I missed yours, please do [get in touch](mailto:mark@improve.dk).
