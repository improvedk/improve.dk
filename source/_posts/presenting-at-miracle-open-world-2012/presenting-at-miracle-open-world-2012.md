Having presented at Miracle Open World back to back in 2010 and 2011, I’m excited to announce I’ll also be present in 2012! Not only will I be presenting, I’ll be presenting a full day track.

<!-- more -->

I’ve been continually improving my original internals training day that I [presented at SQLBits](/presenting-a-precon-at-sqlbits). At MOW, I’ll be presenting the evolved session, which now also includes compression internals. As the allotted time at MOW is slightly shorter than at SQLBits, and I have slightly more material, expect to bring coffee :)

For more details on the session, please see [the description at the MOW website](http://mow2012.dk/program/sql-server-storage-engine.aspx).
