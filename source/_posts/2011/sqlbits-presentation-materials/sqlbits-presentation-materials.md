I’ve got a blog post coming up tomorrow on general SQLBits reflections (‘twas awesome), for now I’ll just post my session materials as promised :)

## Precon attendees

To those of you who attended my precon – thank you! I’m trying to see if I can get the materials sent out to you directly. Until I get that figured out, you can email me at [mark@improve.dk](mailto:mark@improve.dk) and I’ll send the materials directly to you. I’m not keen on publishing the whole slide deck and demo archive so I hope you understand.

## Knowing the Internals – Who Needs SQL Server Anyway?

Once again – thanks for attending! It was an extremely fast paced session but I hope you got an idea of what’s going on behind the scenes of SQL Server.

You can download a rar file containing the slide deck, the SNSC tool and the demos here:
