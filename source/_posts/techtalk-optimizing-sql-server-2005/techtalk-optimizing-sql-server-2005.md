I held a TechTalk on optimizing SQL Server 2005 on the 21st of January. I think it went well so I'm looking forward to the evaluations - please fill them out :)

I have put up the slides, code and test database backup for you to download.

[Optimizing_SQL_Server_2005.zip - Slides + code](Optimizing_SQL_Server_2005.zip)  
[Test.zip - DB Backup](Test.zip)

Note that the slides are in **Danish** - sorry non-danes.

As I mentioned at the end of the TechTalk, I barely made it through all of my slides, and that's even after I sacrificed a lot of the topics & depth I wanted to talk about. Depending on the evaluations I get back, I'll probably be announcing a part 2 on this topic later on.

The tool I used to generate test data was Red Gate's [SQL Data Generator](http://www.red-gate.com/products/SQL_Data_Generator/index.htm). It's a great tool for quickly making a large set of test data so you can analyze the actual benefits of a properly indexed table.
