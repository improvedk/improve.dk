I am presenting a session called "Using Network Load Balancing for Availability & Scalability" - I know, original naming is not really part of my skillset. During the session, I will be introducing NLB and demoing how to set it up using a multitude of VMs (might have to get an extra 4 gigs of memory in my laptop). I will also cover some of the basic characteristics scalable & available websites must possess, and how to solve the issue of reliable session state when we start to load balance our webservers - without resorting to SQL Server.

I look forward to attending devLink 2009, it's an awesome list of sessions & speakers! Hope to see some of you there.
