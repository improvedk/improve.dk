Over the last years Iâ€™ve been doing less and less coding while doing more and more management. As of today I'm taking it a step further as I'm assuming the role of CEO at [iPaper A/S]((http://www.ipaper.dk).

While this does mean less coding at work, I won't be going full manager. I'll still be reverse engineering databases in my spare time, I'll still be debugging interesting problems, just as I'll still continue contributing to open source.

## Me, Myself & SQL Server
Though I won't be giving up coding, this will have an impact on the amount of time I can spend on extracurricular activies, such as presenting. Unfortunately this also means I won't be able to participate in neither the MVP nor the SQL PASS summits this year. I had really looked forward to joining the MVP summit for the first time, but unfortunately I will have to prioritize time differently for now.

This is **not** a goodbye to the family, simply an explanation for why I won't be seeing you this November.
