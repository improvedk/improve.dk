Well hello there; I'm Mark!

## What do I do for a living?
I love working at [iPaper A/S](http://www.ipaper-cms.com/) as the CTO with responsibilities ranging from cleaning the floors to racking up servers, team management, tuning databases and converting Red Bull & caffeine to code.

## How did I get here?

The earliest tools I remember using are [QBasic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) and [Netscape Composer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Composer). Searching online, the earliest online post by me seems to be [this mail](http://support.realsoftware.com/listarchives/realbasic-nug/2001-04/msg01267.html) from the [Realbasic mailing list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realbasic), back in April 2001. Looking back, it suddenly feels as if it was yesterday.

I quickly threw myself at web development, first [ASP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages), shortly succeeded by [ASP.NET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET) with interspersed bits of [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP).

After a couple of years working with web development at [Webdanmark](http://www.webdanmark.com/), I turned independent and spent the next four-or-so years doing various consulting work – most of it web & database related. During this, I had the pleasure of being the first developer at [Trustpilot](http://www.trustpilot.com/). While helping get Trustpilot under way I'd also been the helping start up [iPaper A/S](http://www.ipaper-cms.com/) and had come to a crossroad – I only had so many hours a week, and I needed to focus. And thus I ended up where I'm at today; after working full time freelance on iPaper for a number of years, I finally joined the company officially in 2008 as the Technical Lead.

## What is it about you and SQL Server?
While I'm a developer at heart, I have a thing for deterministic behavior and data, and what's more deterministic and full of data than a classic RDBMS? I've always been using SQL Server as part of my jobs, but seeing as I constantly wanted to know more, I jumped into the rabbit hole that is internals. As part of my quest to know more than books could tell me, I ended up developing an [open source parser for SQL Server data files](https://github.com/improvedk/OrcaMDF), also known as OrcaMDF. Creating OrcaMDF gave me an immense amount of experience and unique knowledge, experience I've later used extensively to present at user groups and conferences.

## How do I combat my stage fright?

I used to suffer from a severe case of stage fright, being practically unable to stand at the blackboard during classes. Since the school days I've forced myself to start presenting, and lo and behold, I started liking it. While building up confidence on the stage, I've had the pleasure of presenting at a multitude of conferences, including places like [SQLBits](http://sqlbits.com/), [PASS](http://www.sqlpass.org/), [DevConnections](http://www.devconnections.com/), [NT Konferenca](http://www.ntk.si/) and [NDC Oslo](http://www.ndcoslo.com/), just to name a few.

## At a more personal level...
I love driving my motorcycle through the Alps of Europe. Always carrying my camera, whether I'm using a [GoPro](http://gopro.com/) mounted to my bike, or a my DSLR mounted to a tripod for those exciting long-exposure shots. Last but not least, when in need of relaxation, you'll find me either on the golf course or in a nearby river, looking to hook a monster [grayling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayling_(species)).
